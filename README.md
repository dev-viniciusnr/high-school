# High School Exercises

This repository contains programming exercises I created and practiced during my high school years.  
These files were recently recovered from my local machine and serve as a record of my early learning experiences with logic, problem-solving, and basic programming concepts.

While they are simple, these exercises represent the beginning of my journey in software development and helped build my foundation as a programmer.
